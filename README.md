#Visualroo
Visualroo is a client side web application developed in JavaScript used for teaching regression and statistical dependence (correlation). It connects to a [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) schema using an API key. Two variables from the schema can be selected and visualized. Visualroo uses [mljs](https://github.com/mljs/ml) simple linear regression to find the equation for the fitted line and visualizes the results using [plotly.js] (https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/).
A demo page is available [here](https://visualroo.my.to/) where you can try it!
